# Multi-Area-Project

Designed a corporate network with five geographical locations, two headquarters with three departments each and three branch offices with two departments each using cisco packet tracer
OSPF was used to implement several areas. Changed the hello timings and implemented HSRP for both the headquarters.
The DHCP and DNS servers were implemented 
Using the Extended Access list, I was able to grant Finance department access to all other departments while preventing other departments from accessing Finance
